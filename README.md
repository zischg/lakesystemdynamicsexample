# lakesystemdynamicsexample

## **A simple lake system dynamics model**

Shows how a lake system behaves during an extreme weather (high inflow) event under non-linear relationships between lake level, lake volume, lake outflow, human interventions, and erosion.
The model can be used to show the effects of feedbacks, tipping points, thresholds, and time lags.

The data is not 100% real data.
